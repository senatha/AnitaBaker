<h5>     Anita Baker was born on January 26, 1958 in Toledo, Ohio. At 2 years old, her mother abandoned her and Baker was raised by a foster family in Detroit, Michigan. When Baker was 12, her foster parents died and was then raised by her foster sister. By the time Baker was 16, she began singing at Detroit nightclubs. One day, she was discovered by bandleader David Washington. Baker joined Chapter 8 in 1975 and the group toured until securing a deal with Ariola Records in 1979. The group's first album, Chapter 8, was released the same year. Chapter 8 was dropped by Arista Records in 1979. They were convinced that Baker, as the group's lead singer, didn't have "star potential." Baker returned to Detroit, working as a law firm receptionist. In 1982, Otis Smith, a former associate of Ariola, convinced Baker to start a solo career under his Beverly Glen label. Baker married Walter Bridgeforth, Jr. on December 24, 1988. The couple separated in and finalized their divorce in 2007. They have two sons, Walter Baker Bridgeforth and Edward Carlton Bridgeforth. Baker currently lives in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan. More than five years after her divorce, Baker filed for a legal name change from Bridgeforth to Baker in her private life.</h5>

<h5>Baker released her debut solo album, The Songstress, in 1983. Baker later complained that she hadn't received any royalties from her work. By 1984, after two years, Baker sought to leave the label but was sued by Smith for breach of contract in 1985. After months in court debating the matter, it was concluded that Baker should be allowed to record for other labels, winning the case against Smith. Baker then signed with  Elektra Records label in 1985 and began working on her next album. Her Elektra contract allowed the singer to have creative control and produce her own music, something she wasn't allowed to do at Beverly Glen.

In March 1986, Baker released her second album, Rapture. By 1988, the album had sold over 8 million copies worldwide, 5 million of which were sold in the United States alone. The album resulted in Baker's winning two Grammy Awards at the 1987 ceremony. In 1987, Baker collaborated with The Winans on their song, "Ain't No Need to Worry", which gave Baker a third Grammy, this time in the Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus category.</h5>

<h5>Taking a hiatus after the end of the Rhythm of Love Tour to care for her two sons, Baker returned to the studio in 2000. In May 2001, Baker filed a lawsuit against Zomba Recording and its Dreamhire division for alleged damage to her recordings caused by the hired 24-track tape machine. Due to a label restructuring, Baker was let go from Atlantic that November without releasing any material with the company. During this hiatus, Rhino Records released the compilation, The Best of Anita Baker in June 2002. The album eventually was certified platinum. Anita Baker returned to live performing and that September she released the album, My Everything . In 2005, Baker released Christmas Fantasy, winning a Grammy nomination. In May 2005, Baker was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. Starting in 2007, Baker embarked on a two-year concert tour titled An Evening with Anita Baker. She occasionally sang the American national anthem at sports events. In August 2012, Baker released her version of Tyrese's hit, "Lately". The song made headlines for Baker after the song was played on every single hour of the hour throughout the day on urban adult contemporary radio, making her the first artist to make this kind of debut. In February 2013, she appeared at the Grammys where "Lately" was nominated for a Grammy Award. In January 2017, Baker confirmed she had retired but in 2018 Anita Baker came out of retirement and is now on tour.</h5>
